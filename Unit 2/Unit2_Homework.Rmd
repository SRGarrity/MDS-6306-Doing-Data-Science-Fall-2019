```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r "ls", echo=FALSE}
system("ls")
```

## Load Data:
```{r}
setwd("/Users/stevengarrity/SMU_MSDS/DS6306_DoingDataScience/DDS_Git/Unit 2/")
playerbb = read.csv("PlayersBBall.csv", header = TRUE)
summary(playerbb)
```


## Question 1

Use the PlayerBBall.csv dataset to visually represent (summarize) the number of players in each position.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
playerbb %>% ggplot(aes(x=position)) + geom_bar

#mpg %>% ggplot(aes(x = class)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Distribution of Class")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
