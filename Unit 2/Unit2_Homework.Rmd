```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r "ls", echo=FALSE}
system("ls")
```

## Load Data:
```{r playerbb, results='hide'}
playerbb = read.csv("/Users/stevengarrity/SMU_MSDS/DS6306_DoingDataScience/DDS_Git/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv", header = TRUE)
summary(playerbb)
```

## Question 1
Use the PlayerBBall.csv dataset to visually represent (summarize) the number of players in each position.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
playerbb %>% ggplot(aes(x=position)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Number of Players in Each Position")
```

## Question 2
Use the dataset to visually investigate the distribution of the weight of centers (C) is greater than the distribution of the weight of forwards (F).

```{r}

```
