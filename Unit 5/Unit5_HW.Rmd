```

## From asynch:
Run the code below. 61 sentences are selected in the has_color object.  Inspect sentence 41 and 43, and explain what the problem is and why it is occurring.
For live session, fix the problem, and reproduce the plot.
```{r}
colors = c("orange","blue","yellow","green","purple","brown","red")
color_expression = str_c(colors, collapse = "|")
color_expression
has_color = str_subset(sentences,color_expression) # filtering based on the variable color_expression
has_color
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
